# My Console App

This project is a console application built using C# and Entity Framework. It serves as a demonstration of how to create a simple data-driven application.

## Project Structure

- **Models/ExampleModel.cs**: Defines the `ExampleModel` class, representing the data model with properties corresponding to database columns and methods for data manipulation.
  
- **Data/AppDbContext.cs**: Contains the `AppDbContext` class, inheriting from `DbContext`. This class configures the database connection and defines entity sets (DbSet) for the models.

- **Migrations/**: This folder contains migration files generated by Entity Framework to track changes in data models and synchronize them with the database.

- **Program.cs**: The entry point of the application. It includes the `Main` method, which configures and runs the application, and may contain logic for interacting with the database.

- **appsettings.json**: Contains application configuration settings, including the database connection string and other configuration options.

- **my-console-app.csproj**: The C# project file that includes information about dependencies, platform version, and build settings.

## Getting Started
